# Hi, I'm Hafiz Atta Ur Rahman 👋

🎓 M.Phil in Computer Science (Gold Medalist)  
Former PHP & WordPress developer rebuilding from scratch with Python.  
One project a day. Everything documented publicly.

## 🚀 The Challenge

**#60DaysOfPython** — Started from zero, building one real project every single day.  
Currently on **Day 26** — React frontend started, Register page live and connected to backend.

🔗 **Live API (Day 19):** [day19-deployment-production.up.railway.app/docs](https://day19-deployment-production.up.railway.app/docs) — deployed FastAPI + Postgres, tested end-to-end against a real production database.

🎓 **Capstone in progress:** [AI-Powered Educational Platform](https://github.com/studyhaxer/capstone-edu-platform) — FastAPI + PostgreSQL + JWT auth + Groq-generated lesson summaries + React frontend, deploying to **usachunian.com**. Full Day 20–33 roadmap in the repo README.

|-------|------|----------------|
| Python Core | 1–6 | Basics, CLI, file handling, OOP, JSON/CSV, logging, modular architecture |

<summary>📋 Day-by-day breakdown</summary>

| Day | Project | What I Learned |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| 1–6 | Student Grade Analyzer (v1–v7) | Python basics, CLI, file handling, OOP, JSON/CSV, logging, validation, modular architecture |
| 7–9 | Bank System & Library Management System | Encapsulation, `@property`, deposit/withdraw, inheritance, polymorphism, base class design |
| 10 | Student Management System | SQLite, CRUD, multi-file structure |
| 11–13 | FastAPI APIs (Notes & SQLite) | REST routes, Pydantic models, full CRUD, SQLAlchemy ORM, `Depends()`, `response_model`, keyword search & filters |
| 14 | User Course API | One-to-Many relationships, cascade delete, `joinedload`, nested schemas |
| 15 | JWT Authentication API | JWT (python-jose), bcrypt password hashing, OAuth2PasswordBearer, protected routes via `Depends()` |
| 16 | Role-Based API | Role field on the User model, role-gated routes via dependency factories (`require_role`, `require_any_role`), reusable `pagination_params` dependency, deliberate 401-vs-403 design, `SECRET_KEY` moved to environment variable |
| 17 | Reusable Auth & Role Dependencies | Refactored Day 16's inline role checks into a single reusable `require_any_role` dependency factory; `get_current_user` fully isolated as a standalone dependency; added a "any logged-in user" route (`/me`) and a multi-role route (`/dashboard`); combined `get_db` + role dependency in the same route |
| 18 | FastAPI Testing + Cleanup | pytest suite with TestClient, conftest fixtures with autouse reset_db (clean DB per test), isolated test database, custom exception classes (ForbiddenException, NotFoundException), consistent permission-before-fetch pattern across endpoints, role-based test coverage (401 / 403 / 200 scenarios) |
| 19 | Production Deployment | Swapped SQLite for managed Supabase Postgres; moved `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` fully into platform env vars; fixed Uvicorn start command for dynamic `$PORT` + `0.0.0.0` binding; deployed to Railway; verified full request lifecycle (register → login → protected routes) against the live database, not just that the server started |
| **20** | **Capstone Kickoff — AI-Powered Educational Platform** | **Designed 4-table schema (`User`, `Course`, `Lesson`, `Enrollment`) with a proper many-to-many `Enrollment` bridge model, `UniqueConstraint` to prevent duplicate enrollments, `NOT NULL` foreign keys; Pydantic schemas with nested `List[LessonOut]`; resolved a production-grade Supabase IPv6/DNS issue by switching to the session pooler connection string; verified all tables live in Supabase and pushed to a dedicated capstone repo** |
| **21** | **Capstone — Auth Routes (JWT)** | **Split routes into a `routers/` package using `APIRouter`; `POST /auth/register` with duplicate-email check and bcrypt hashing; `POST /auth/login` via `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` (so Swagger's Authorize flow works end-to-end) issuing a JWT with `sub` as the user id; `GET /users/me`; `GET /users` admin-only via a `require_any_role` dependency guard; full register → login → /me → 403/401 smoke testing in `/docs`** |
| **22** | **Capstone — Course CRUD** | **Full CRUD on `Course` (`POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /courses`); teacher-only creation; ownership validation on update/delete via `owner_id` so teachers can only modify their own courses; authenticated read access for all roles; consistent status codes (201/200/204/403/404) across every route** |
| **24** | **Capstone — AI Lesson Summarizer** | **Integrated Groq API (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`); `POST /lessons/{id}/summarize` fetches lesson content, sends it to Groq with a structured prompt, and returns a clean summary; `.env`-based API key management; role-gated to authenticated users** |
| **25** | **Capstone — pytest Test Suite** | **28 automated tests across 4 files (auth, courses, lessons, enrollments); `conftest.py` with `client`, `teacher_token`, `student_token`, `teacher2_token` fixtures; tests cover happy paths, duplicate 400s, ownership 403s, role 403s, and unauthenticated 401s; 0 failures** | **Nested lesson routes under `/courses/{course_id}/lessons`, with ownership checked one level removed via `lesson.course.owner_id` (lessons have no `owner_id` of their own); `PUT`/`DELETE /lessons/{id}`; `Enrollment` bridge table wired up — `POST /enroll` catches the DB-level `UniqueConstraint` violation as an `IntegrityError`, rolls back the session, and returns a clean 400 instead of a 500; `GET /my-courses` resolves enrolled courses through the relationship rather than a second query** |
| **26** | **Capstone — React Register Page** | **Vite + React project scaffolded; `axiosClient.js` with base URL config; `Navbar.jsx` with React Router links; `Register.jsx` form with Full Name, Email, Password, Role (student/teacher); POST `/auth/register` connected; success state with green banner; role-based redirect groundwork in place** |
